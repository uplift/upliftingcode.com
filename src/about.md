I'm a Midlands based UK Front End Engineer. This website is my playground, more than 140 character thoughts dropbox and hopefully a chance to give back to the various development communities that have taught me so much and help any new developers just starting on the development path.

If you wish to contact me for any reason, the best place to get a response is on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/uplift5).
